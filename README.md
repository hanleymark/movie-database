Reflection
==========

This felt like a much bigger project which provided a much greater challenge. The brief left lots of room for interpretation which enabled me to choose where to focus my learning. I decided to attempt much more ambitious CSS in order to develop a clear page style.

Key learning:

More complex CSS styling
Using tables to layout dynamic information
More pseudo classes
Modal windows in CSS
More form validation
Dynamically show/hide content for smaller viewports
Add interactivity with edit/add record functionality
Use of Google Fonts API

Next steps:

Add ARIA tags to improve accessibility
Refine modal window layout on smaller devices
